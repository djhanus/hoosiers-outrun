<dt class="text-header">What does it mean to be a Hoosiers Outrun Cancer TEAM?</dt>
<dd class="text">Each year over 100 teams both large and small represent more than 3000 of the 5000 participants at Hoosiers Outrun Cancer.

Many teams have peoples names, some have school names, some have a company name, and some just have crazy 
fun made up names. But no matter what the team name is the thing they have in common is they all have the same goal. That goal is to raise funds and awareness while showing their love and support for someone lost to Cancer, someone currently fighting Cancer 
(we refer to as Warriors), and to celebrate with all of those who are Cancer Survivors.
<br><br>To get a team started all you need to do is have your Team Captain register themselves and your team's name by clicking on this link <a href="https://secure.getmeregistered.com/register.php?event_id=130921&c=64616_667614&mask=64617_64618_68444"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>REGISTER AND CREATE YOUR TEAM NAME</b></a> .

<dt class="text-header">Are children under any certain age free?</dt>
<dd class="text">We understand that it may be difficult for families to pay a registration fee every family member and we encourage everyone to consider this a family event and include everyone.
Your registration fees include the event tee, swag bag, refreshments, and a race number bib (with timing chip for the timed events) therefore you must pay the registration fee for any member of your family to receive these items. However,
you have the option during EARLY registration to purchase addition event tees for $15 if you want everyone to get a tee but the full registration fee is too much. (The extra event tee option for $15 is not guaranteed after EARLY registration ends on September 19th).

<br><br>Children are welcome to participate free of charge with a parent or legal guardian who has registered and signed/accepted a paper or electronic waiver which states (among other things) the following:
<br><br>I understand by the acceptance of this release of liability and assumption of risk waiver I am executing a legally binding agreement to participate 
in the Event which includes myself as well as any accompanying child under 18 years of age, any accompanying persons who may be incapacitated, or mentally 
challenged, registered or unregistered for this event, regardless of whether or not I am the parent/legal guardian (referred to as &#8220;Others accompanying me&#8221;). 

<br><br></dd>
<dt class="text-header">What is a Spirit Runner?</dt>
<dd class="text">A Spirit Runner is a registration category for everyone who wants to be a part of the action but for any reason cannot actively participate. A Spirit Runner is no different than any other participant when it comes to registration deadlines, pricing etc. They are also entitled to the event tee and the Swag Bag just like any other participant. Also just like every other participant they are responsible for retrieving these items during the regularly scheduled PPU times, having a friend or associate retrieve the items for them, or if they are on a team that has selected EARLY TEAM PPU then those items are kitted along with the rest of the team and they can then retrieve their items from their team captain. What they do not receive that makes them different is a race number/bib.
ALL items must be picked up by race day or they are forfeited and used for other purposes.
